# Fey
A 3D game engine written in C++. This is not intended to be a professional production; rather, it is meant to be a personal learning experience.

## Dependencies
This game engine relies on the libraries GLAD, GLFW3, GLM, SOIL, and OpenGL 3.3 or higher. GLAD, GLFW3, SOIL, and GLM are included in this project, so the only dependency that needs to be installed on your computer is OpenGL 3.3.

## Building Fey
1. mkdir -pv build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. sudo make install
